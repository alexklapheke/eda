class DBSCAN(BaseEstimator, ClusterMixin):
    """Memory-light implementation of DBSCAN. Unlike sklearn, does not
    precompute a distance matrix, trading off memory for time. The value
    -1 is assigned to points that don't fit into a cluster. Example usage:

        dbscan = DBSCAN()
        df["cluster"] = dbscan.fit_predict(df)

    You can pass the following options to the instance declaration:

        eps:         The maximum distance to another point for it to be
                     considered part of the same cluster. Default: 0.5
        min_samples: The minimum number of points to be considered a cluster.
                     Default: 5
        p:           The p-norm to use for distance metric. 1 is equivalent to
                     taxicab distance. 2 is equivalent to Euclidean distance.
                     Default: 2

    The .fit() method adds the following properties:

        .is_fit:      This is set to True
        .n_clusters_: The number of clusters, not including the "noise cluster"
        .labels_:     A list of cluster labels corresponding to each value in
                      the data passed to .fit()
        .silhouette_: The silhouette score of the clustering, from -1 (worst)
                      to 1 (best)"""
